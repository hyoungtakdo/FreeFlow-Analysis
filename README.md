# FreeFlow-Analysis

This Tableau dashboard was created in collaboration with **Free Flo Box**, a nonprofit that provides free, anonymous access to menstrual products in Dayton, Ohio. The dashboard visualizes pantry usage data collected since March 2022 and is designed to be accessible to a broad audience, including community members and potential supporters.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a dashboard that:
- Tracks daily, weekly, and monthly usage of tampons, pads, menstrual cups, and period underwear
- Breaks down usage by **product type**, **absorbency**, and **pantry location**
- Estimates **menstrual cycles supported** using standard product usage assumptions
- Highlights Free Flo Box’s impact to increase visibility and inspire community support

The dashboard is intended for embedding on Free Flo Box’s website and social media channels, helping communicate their ongoing impact and the unmet needs in Dayton.
