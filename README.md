# FreeFlow-Analysis

This Tableau dashboard was created in collaboration with **Free Flo Box**, a nonprofit that provides free, anonymous access to menstrual products in Dayton, Ohio. The dashboard visualizes pantry usage data collected since March 2022 and is designed to be accessible to a broad audience, including community members and potential supporters.

## About
In December 2024, I built a dashboard to visualize Free Flow's monthly impact data, highlighting growth in distributions, events, and partnerships since 2022.

The dashboard aims to make nonprofit data accessible, actionable, and visually compelling.
